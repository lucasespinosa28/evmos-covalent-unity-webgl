  "description": "A long time ago, there was a Mask dude that lived on an island. He was a really happy guy and loved to play with the other kids on the island. One day, a big storm came and destroyed the island. The Mask dude was the only one that survived. He was really sad and didn't know what to do. He decided to build a new island and make it even better than the last one. He worked really hard and eventually made it happen. The new island was a huge success and everyone loved it. The Mask dude was really happy and everyone on the island was happy too.",
